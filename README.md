# SubGapChecker
This script has been made to update a whatsapp group on the subgap between pewdiepie and tseries. 
Originally I was going to add a link to whatsapp to this project but since I couldn't get any of them to work I decided to use Pynput and pyperclip to store the sub gap to my clipboard and then simulate ctr + v in the whatsapp chat to send the sub gap update
